This is my test file for git homework.


I used the following instruction for this homework:

Basically, you need to do the following:

    Go to my project's page, fork it. You need to fork it because you don't have a write access to my project.
    Clone it to your local computer, add the file and push it to your repo.
    Send a pull request. I'll review your request, and I might add some comments. If so, you'll need to fix them and push again.
    If your pull request is approved, I'll merge it to my project.
    You'll get a notification. Then you need to update your local master (pull changes from my project) and commit your local master to your fork.

Should you have any question don't hesitate to ask me.


2 important things

    When you do git clone, clone your fork, not my project. That means don't do this
    $ git clone git@github.com:eghonyan/Macadamian-Test-Repo.git
    you should do this
    $ git clone git@github.com:tkarufanyan/Macadamian-Test-Repo.git
    
    When clone it, git creates a branch called master. Do NOT do anything on that branch. 
    If you have a task you should create a branch for that (see the presentation). 
    Create a branch, add the file to your branch, and then push your branch to your fork.
